The SOLID principles are a set of five design principles in object-oriented programming that help developers create more maintainable, scalable, and robust software. These principles aim to make the code easier to understand, extend, and refactor. The acronym SOLID stands for:

S - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
O - Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
L - Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
I - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
D - Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)


Benefits of SOLID Principles
    * Maintainability: Easy to update and fix bugs.
    * Scalability: Simple to add new features.
    * Flexibility: Easy to change implementations or swap components.
    * Reusability: Promotes reusable and modular code.
By following SOLID principles, developers can write clean, understandable, and scalable PHP code..
